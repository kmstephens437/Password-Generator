# Password-Generator

## Description

This Password Generator project was done to better understand and practice deploying window methods such as prompts and confirms. This applicatrion solves the problem of havcing to create your own genuinely random passwords and helps bolster your overall security as it pertains to passwords. During this project, I learned more of the general flow of creating a simple application. I also learned/practiced more applied syntax, the structure of building out an application, and the overall flow of the code.
